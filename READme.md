# ðŸ“˜ HTML5 Semantic Web Page with Accessibility & SEO

## Project Overview

I successfully designed and developed a modern, semantically correct web page that demonstrates my understanding of HTML5 structure, web accessibility principles, and search engine optimization (SEO) best practices. This project showcases my ability to create web content that prioritizes both human and machine readabilityâ€”fundamental pillars of professional web development.

## What I Built

I created a comprehensive web page using HTML5 semantic tags, implementing accessibility best practices and SEO principles from the ground up. My final deliverable demonstrates a well-structured layout that fully supports screen readers and is optimized for search engine discoverability.

## Technical Implementation

I developed this project using exclusively HTML5, focusing on semantic markup without relying on CSS or JavaScript. My approach emphasized meaningful semantic elements throughout the page structure. I deliberately avoided unnecessary `<div>` or `<span>` elements, instead creating clearly defined sections including a header, navigation, main content area, and footer.

I implemented comprehensive accessibility features using proper HTML5 landmarks and attributes that significantly improve navigation for assistive technologies. My HTML structure reflects thoughtful planning of content hierarchy and readability, optimized for both end users and search engines.

For SEO optimization, I strategically employed heading tags in the correct hierarchical order, crafted descriptive and engaging text content, and ensured all content maintains both human readability and crawler-friendly structure. I carefully considered how search engines would interpret my page structure and content clarity.
